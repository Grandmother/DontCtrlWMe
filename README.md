# DontCtrlWMe
Don't close some blocklisted Firefox tabs on Ctrl+W

# Installation

This neither registered as a Firefox addon nor has proper configuration to be good enough for that.
So don't expect proper installation process either. Just follow the official Firefox instruction on
adding your first extension [here][firefox_docs].
